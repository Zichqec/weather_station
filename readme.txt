Weather Station is a plugin for both users and developers, to display and share weather data. Run it from the plugin tab in the right click menu, search your location, and it will update the weather every hour and send the data to all open ghosts. It will also show the current weather/forecast data in the plugin menu.

The hope is that this plugin eases the burden on developers by making it easier to handle weather data, and also makes for a more streamlined experience for users since you only need to input your location in one place.


If you're a developer and want to use the weather data in your ghost, check out the events_reference.txt in the plugin's folder, or view the events on Ukadoc:
https://ukagakadreamteam.github.io/ukadoc/manual/list_shiori_event_ex.html

There is also more information and example code available on the Ukagaka Dream Team wiki:

You may distribute an UNMODIFIED version of this plugin bundled with a ghost.
Redistribution other than this is prohibited.
Modification of the plugin is prohibited.
The code in the .dic files may be copied and adapted with attribution. See my notes in key.dic for details.
	(yaya_plugin2.dic is an exception to this since it comes with YAYA as Plugin. Please see YAYA as Plugin's permissions for that file.)

The plugin may receive updates over time, so if you bundle it with a ghost be aware that it may become out of date.
